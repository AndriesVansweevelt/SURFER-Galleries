In the field below you can enter a formula. SURFER then computes the associated surface and displays it. The formula on the right always equals zero.
\\
The equation can contain the following elements:
\newline
Variables:
\[x, y, z, \]
Coefficients in form of numbers or parameters:
\[1, 2, 3, \dots a, b, c, \dots, \]
Arithmetic operations:
\[+,  - , \cdot \quad \textnormal{and} \]
Exponents:
\[ ^2, ^3, ^n .\]
Every point of the coordinate system is represented by a value for each of the three variables  $x$, $y$ and $z$. If the term replacing the variables with the values of this point equals zero, then the point will be displayed. Through a method called \textit{ray tracing} the programme finds all such points; they are called zeroes of the equation. All these points together then form the surface.
