Galleries of the SURFER program
===============================

This repository contains the LaTeX sources of the galleries that come with the [SURFER](http://imaginary.org/program/surfer/) program. They consist of a tutorial gallery, a gallery containing so-called world record surfaces (i.e. surfaces with many singularities) and a galleriy with surfaces which are just nice (fantasy surfaces).

The galleries have already been translated to various languages other then the English and German. Translations to additional languages as well as improvements of existing translations are highly welcome.
